If computer programs run fine and things only slow down when using the internet, you should <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" title="go to Speed Test" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">check your internet speed</a>. If it's not what you are paying for, call your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p><p>In general, a computer infected with malware will also run slower.  And a web browser with dozens of extensions (add-ons) will not only slow the computer down, but can also be in invitation for more malware.  Visit the <a href="https://francisit.com/online-help.html" title="go to Online Help">Online Help</a> page to do an online security scan or two - or three!  If a computer runs slow when a web browser isn't open, when starting up or shutting down, or if just a few programs are open, then adding more memory (RAM,) if possible, or upgrading the HDD to a SSD (by hard drive cloning) for storage may help, particularly if the computer was an expensive model when first purchased. (Don't confuse a computer's memory with its hard drive - <a href="https://francisit.com/memory.html" title="The difference between computer memory and storage">an explanation is here</a>.) However, if the computer is six years old or older, it may be time for a new one. FIT can advise you on whether to upgrade or purchase a new PC. Low end Win 11 PCs are roughly selling for $400 to $600. The better PCs are in the $700 to $1,000 range. Francis IT regularly recommends buying computers directly from the manufacturer or Costco. Costco often provides better hardware for the price and more importantly a free two year extended warranty, free technical support and a 90 day return policy. <br><br><a href="https://francisit.com/malware.html" title="go to Malware summary">Malware</a> (spyware, worms, ransomware, viruses, pop-ups, Trojans, bad browser extensions or "browser search engines," etc.) may also cause a computer to slow down as a result of opening multiple windows or processes in the background. Usually one infection leads to another so it's a good idea to clean up the situation before it gets worse. Here's an article on <a href="https://francisit.com/infections.html" title="Indications a computer is infected with malware">the most common signs that a computer is infected</a>. Unfortunately many of the free antivirus, antimalware and antispyware programs advertised on the Internet and TV/Cable do not work as advertised. Some will scan your computer, tell you that it is infected - even if it isn't - and then request that you purchase an additional program to fix the problems (this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scareware" title="look up scareware in Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">scareware</a>.) The current and previous MacOS's, Sequoia 15 and macOS 14 Sonoma have excellent built-in antimalware software that keeps the computer and user safe.  And finally <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with Microsoft Windows 10</span> reaching end of life on October 14, 2025 be assured Win 11 Home and Pro leave both the PC and user quite safe without additional security. If you are a business owner, you should consider an enterprise network solution so that all your current and future needs are met long term.  If you do decide to buy additional antivirus or antimalware software, stick with reputable products! <br><br>Francis IT has tools that will stop malware, remove it and protect your computer against further threats.
