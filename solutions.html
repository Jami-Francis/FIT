Check <a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate" title="go to Microsoft Security and Critical Updates" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Security and Critical Updates</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541" title="go to Apple Software Updates" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apple's Software Updates.</a> Make sure your device is charging before you start the update. Both newer Macs (Sequoia '24, Sonoma '23, Ventura '22) and Win 11 PCs have excellent anti-malware and antivirus software built into them. Visit 'Security' on your device and familiarize yourself with it.  Next is to determine if you need an additional antivirus or anti-malware program installed for added protection.  Most systems don't. Both Mac's and Win 11 are highly secure out of the box. It's important to mention that Francis IT often finds outdated antivirus programs installed on Macs and PCs.  The owner see that they have something installed but don't realize it is not working because they have not been paying the annual fee to keep their account current. By uninstalling an old, unsupported security app, and rebooting, the system (the Mac or Win PC) immediately takes back "command and control" of security and starts protecting the computer in real time immediately. </p><p>It's crucial to always <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/install-updates-reader-acrobat.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">keep Adobe Acrobat Reader updated</a> to the latest version to benefit most from recent security patches and features. Unfortunately, despite enhanced security measures built into Acrobat Reader, users should remain cautious when opening PDF files from unknown or untrusted sources, as they can still pose a security risk. By default, Reader installs with the auto update function turned on. Don't let a scareware pop-up on your screen trick you into 'updating' <em>ANY</em> application. Update apps from within the app itself, making sure Auto Update is ON. <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> Getting tricked (<a href="https://francisit.com/social-engineering.html" title="go to Social Engineering">through social engineering</a>)  into upgrading or installing a fake application or program on to the computer.  And this is the most common way of getting malware installed on any computer.

This occurs because these units are passed from customer to customer and are rarely inspected by cable companies for their customers. Asking a cable tech to show you that NAT or SPI is turned on is always a good idea.
