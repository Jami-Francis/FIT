Here are some common examples:</p><p><strong>Tech Support Scam:</strong> A specialized form of vishing (not phishing) that begins with a pop-up Scareware <span style="font-size: inherit;">alert</span><span style="font-size: inherit;"> (see below) designed to look like a system infection notice from a major company (like Microsoft, Apple, McAfee, Norton, etc.) The victim is directed to call a fraudulent number, which connects them to a scammer who then attempts to gain remote access to the computer to steal data, install malware, or charge hundreds of dollars for a "fix."</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> The scam proceeds in four key stages: 1) The user gets a non-closable Scareware pop-up warning of a critical infection.  2) The pop-up instructs the user to call a specific number (transitioning to Vishing.)  3) The fraudulent "technician" uses high-pressure tactics to "prove" the infection.  4) The scammer convinces the victim to download remote access software so the scammer can access the computer, ask you to open your bank account, steal data, etc..</p></li></ul><p><strong>Top Warning Signs of a Tech Support Scam<br></strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">Unexpected Pop-ups or Warnings:  Any sudden alert demanding immediate action (like calling a number or clicking a link) that appears while you are browsing and uses urgent, frightening language like "CRITICAL ERROR" is a scam. Legitimate tech companies do not operate this way.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Demand to Call a Number:</strong>  The alert or call-back number is the crucial link for the scammer. Real tech support companies will never use a pop-up to demand you call an unverified number to fix a security issue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Request for Remote Access:</strong>  The scammer's primary goal is to convince you to download and install a common, legitimate remote access tool like TeamViewer, AnyDesk, LogMeIn, etc. Once they have control, they can steal information or lock your device. Never grant unexpected remote access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Demand for Unusual Payment:</strong>  If the "technician" demands immediate payment using non-traceable methods like gift cards, cryptocurrency, or wire transfers, it is a definitive sign of fraud.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pretexting: </strong>Creating an elaborate, invented scenario (the "pretext") to trick a victim into divulging information or taking action. This often involves prior research and impersonation to establish legitimacy.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> A con artist impersonates a high-level executive from a company's financial services partner. They call an employee in the accounting department, claiming an urgent and sensitive wire transfer needs to be completed, and they have the authority to bypass standard protocols. They provide a fake authorization code and other details, convincing the employee to execute the fraudulent transfer.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Phishing:</strong> The most prevalent form of social engineering, this technique uses fraudulent communication, typically email or text message, designed to look like it comes from a legitimate source (e.g., a bank, a well-known company, or a coworker). The goal is to trick the recipient into clicking a malicious link, downloading an infected attachment, or entering sensitive data on a fake login page.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> An employee receives an urgent-sounding email titled "Action Required: Payroll Update" that appears to be from the company's HR department. The email warns their direct deposit will be suspended unless they click a link to "verify their credentials." The link leads to a spoofed login page that captures the employee's username and password when they attempt to log in.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Smishing:</strong> A type of phishing attack conducted via SMS (text message). Attackers send fraudulent, urgent messages, often impersonating a bank or shipping company, to get the recipient to click a malicious link or call a fraudulent number. The high trust and quick action associated with text messaging make this technique highly successful.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> A user receives a text message claiming to be from their bank, stating their debit card has been locked and instructing them to click a short link to "verify your identity" and unlock the account. The link takes them to a fake banking login page that steals their credentials.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Vishing:</strong> A type of phishing attack conducted over a voice call (VoIP, landline, or mobile). The attacker impersonates a trustworthy entity (like a government agency or tech support) and relies on live conversation and social pressure to convince the victim to hand over sensitive information or perform a damaging action, like installing remote connection software.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> An automated or live caller claims to be from a bank, the IRS or Social Security Administration and threatens the victim with immediate arrest or financial penalty unless they provide personal information or transfer money to settle a fake "urgent debt."</p></li></ul><p><strong>Water Holing:</strong> Targeting users on websites they frequently visit and trust. Attackers compromise these trusted sites to set traps, knowing users are less cautious in familiar environments.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> Hackers compromise a website that is a popular resource for employees of a specific corporation. They embed malicious code on the site that automatically infects the computers of anyone visiting it, especially those coming from the corporation's IP addresses, thereby gaining a foothold in the company's network.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Baiting:</strong> Similar to a real-world Trojan horse, this technique uses physical media like malware-infected USB drives or CDs or DVDs left in public places, relying on victims' curiosity or greed. These "road apples" are often given enticing labels to encourage insertion into a computer. Any name brand game or album is sweet enough.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> An employee finds a USB drive in the company parking lot labeled "Confidential Employee Bonuses." The employee's curiosity leads them to plug the drive into their work computer, which then secretly installs malware that provides the attacker with remote access to the company's network.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Quid Pro Quo:</strong> An attacker offers something in return for a favor, such as providing "free IT help" in exchange for login credentials.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> An attacker poses as a help desk technician and calls a random employee. They claim to be conducting a routine system upgrade and offer to "help" the employee by guiding them through the process. The attacker then asks for the employee's username and password, promising that it's a necessary step to complete the upgrade, and a new password will be issued afterward.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Scareware:</strong> Bombarding victims with fake threats and alerts to convince them their system is infected, ultimately tricking them to install malicious software or extorting a ransom.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> While browsing online, a user receives a pop-up window that flashes and blares an alert, claiming, "Your computer has been infected with a virus! Click here to download a free scanner." The user clicks the link in a panic, and the "scanner" they download is actually a malicious program that locks their files and demands a ransom to decrypt them. Microsoft will not call you to get on your computer!</p></li></ul><p><strong>Tailgating (Piggybacking):</strong> An attacker physically follows an authorized person into a restricted area, often by pretending to be someone with legitimate access (e.g., a delivery person) and asking the authorized person to hold the door.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For example:</strong> An attacker, dressed in a delivery uniform with a few boxes in their hands, waits near the secured entrance to a data center. When an employee scans their badge and opens the door, the attacker calls out, "Hey, can you grab this for me?" or simply gestures with their full hands, prompting the employee to hold the door open out of politeness, allowing the attacker to slip in without being challenged. The goal is to insert a usb drive for remote access or a keylogger in to a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=IOT+device" title="IOT device on Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IOT device</a> or PC.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Notable Social Engineering Incidents -</strong> in almost every case a person clicked on a link they shouldn't have.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters-560-million-customers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2024 Ticketmaster Data Breach</a>: </strong>  The hacker group ShinyHunters claimed responsibility and stated they had stolen 1.3 terabytes of data from 560 million Ticketmaster customers.
