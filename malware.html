This term covers everything from slightly annoying pop-up advertising to truly destructive acts like stealing personal passwords and data, or even infecting every other machine on a network. Currently, malware is responsible for a huge amount of cybercrime, playing a role in the vast majority of all data breaches worldwide. While massive hacking operations against multinational corporations definitely make the news, the average computer user or small business is unfortunately no longer unaffected; they are frequently the target of this pervasive digital threat.</p><h5>The Core Types of Malware</h5><p>Malware has been around since the beginning of software itself, and while criminals are constantly developing new threats, most still fit into a few established categories.</p><h6>Viruses and Worms</h6><p>Perhaps the most famous type of malware is the <strong>virus</strong>. These harmful programs are designed to infect legitimate software. Once you install and run an infected program, the virus activates, quietly spreads to other programs on your computer, and then takes its destructive action, which could be anything from deleting critical operating system files to stealing information.<br><br><strong>Worms</strong>, on the other hand, are stand-alone programs. Unlike viruses, they don't need to attach to an existing program to cause havoc; they're able to replicate and transmit themselves directly across a network.</p><h6>Trojans and Their Disguises</h6><p>Another extremely common type is the <strong>Trojan Horse</strong>, which gets its name from Greek mythology. Trojans present themselves as harmless "gifts"—like a free game, utility, or even a supposed security update—to trick you into installing them. This is what we call <a href="https://francisit.com/social-engineering.html">social engineering</a>, where the malware uses tricks or scares you into thinking it's legitimate. The easiest way people accidentally install a Trojan is by clicking a link or opening an attachment in an unsolicited email. Emails that look like they're from your bank, a well-known company like FedEx, UPS, USPS or PayPal, or even a government agency are classic bait. Even if an email looks genuine, your safest bet is to delete it, then contact the company or person directly via their official phone number or by typing their URL directly into a fresh browser window. Trojans often don't try to inject themselves into other files like viruses do, and today, they've actually replaced viruses as the primary method of initial infection.</p><h6>Adware and Spyware</h6><p><strong>Adware</strong> is essentially financially motivated malware that bombards you with unwanted advertisements. These programs can hijack your browser for profit; as you surf the web, they display ads you wouldn't normally see, and the criminal earns a few cents every time you click. The most common adware and some Trojans install themselves by hiding within fake PC utilities that promise to fix or improve system performance. Adware can also appear as a new <a href="https://francisit.com/browser-extensions.html">web browser extension</a> or search engine. Remember that any <i>legitimate</i> updates your computer needs will typically present themselves automatically when you start your machine, not thirty minutes after you've started surfing the web. If you're ever in doubt, save your work, restart your computer, and let your operating system or program handle its updates through official channels. If you are concerned of an infection that may have been overlooked by your antivirus program, consider using an <a href="https://francisit.com/online-help.html">Online scanner</a> like one of those FIT recommends.</p><p><strong>Spyware</strong> is exactly what it sounds like: it secretly gathers information—like the websites you visit, browser and system information, and your IP address—and transmits it to interested third parties. Spyware usually doesn't have its own mechanism to infect a system; instead, it's typically 'dropped' onto your machine by a Trojan. Once installed, it silently collects data to avoid detection.</p><h5>The Most Dangerous Modern Threat - Ransomware</h5><p>The newest and arguably most terrifying threat is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ransomware</a>. This is a type of data-encrypting malware that attempts to hold all your data hostage. While it still allows some basic computer functionality, you can't access your own files unless you pay the ransom. Though it's a huge problem, sometimes technicians can successfully restore encrypted data by using tools to access features like Windows' Shadow Explorer or existing backups.</p><p>Any type of malware can cause severe damage by exploiting, deleting, or altering critical files and databases, which is why running a good, standalone anti-malware program alongside your operating system's built-in security features is always a smart idea for extra protection.</p><h5>The Business of Cybercrime: Botnets</h5><p>The really savvy cybercriminals, often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"Black Hat" hackers</a>, monetize all these types of malware through Zombies, Bots, and Botnets.</p><p>When an unprotected computer gets infected and isn't completely cleaned, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rootkit</a> can be left behind. A Rootkit is essentially a stealth cloak; it can hide itself so well that even reputable antivirus programs have trouble finding it. A computer can be hiding a Rootkit even after a virus scan, and sometimes the only way to confirm its presence is by examining unusual internet connections being made when no web browsers are open.</p><p>A <strong>bot</strong> is a software application or script that performs repetitive tasks on command, like sending spam email. While there are "good" bots that index websites, malicious bots allow criminals to take complete remote control of an infected computer. These infected machines are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zombies</a> and are usually part of a botnet.</p><p>Taking control of one computer is helpful, but the real money is in infecting huge numbers of them and networking them into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Botnet</a> so they can all be controlled at once for massive, malicious acts. These computer owners become unwitting accomplices, and most would be shocked to learn that the bulk of the spam we all receive is being sent from millions of computers just like theirs. The owners can still use their machines, often unaware anything is wrong beyond perhaps thinking their computer seems a bit slow at times. Amazingly, Rootkits can even hide stolen information, reporting that a hard drive is empty when it’s actually packed with files gathered through corporate espionage.</p><p>In 2024 the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/911-s5-botnet-dismantled-and-its-administrator-arrested-coordinated-international-operation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FBI</a> and international partners dismantled <a href="https://www.cobalt.io/blog/fbi-dismantles-worlds-largest-botnet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">911 S5</a>, likely the world’s largest Botnet, spanning nearly 200 countries and linked to over 19 million computers. This malicious network, responsible for a wide array of cybercrimes, notably targeted pandemic relief funds, resulting in an estimated $5.9 billion in fraudulent unemployment claims.</p><p>Cybercriminals use these powerful botnets in several ways to make money. They use them to send spam, sell illegal goods, launch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">phishing attacks</a>,<span style="font-size: inherit;"> or execute large-scale scams. They also collect stolen information, which they use for </span><strong style="font-size: inherit;">identity theft</strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">, unauthorized credit card purchases, or opening loan accounts under the victim’s name.</span></p><p>The botnets' primary and most profitable use, however, is launching <strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks</strong>. These flood and overwhelm a company's website or network with a crushing volume of traffic, severely slowing it down or crashing it entirely. This is monetized in two primary ways: first, through extortion, where criminals demand a ransom to stop the attack; and second, by being paid by hostile groups - including political "hacktivists" or foreign intelligence organizations - who want to inflict damage. In a dark twist, cybercriminals often lease these powerful botnets to other criminals looking to launch their own destructive attacks.</p><p>It truly takes only hours for an unprotected computer (one not behind a router and running an old operating system) to be infected with malicious software, which underscores the critical need for everyone to keep their OS, applications and security software fully up-to-date.</p></div></div><div><p><br>Here is a brief list of <a href="https://francisit.com/worldwide-botnets.html" title="go to 9 of the worst worldwide botnets">nine of the worst worldwide botnets</a> and the damage they caused.<br><br></p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-left"><span style="color: #843fa1;">© FrancisIT.com 2025</span></p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://francisit.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://francisit.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script></body></html>
